* [All about redirection](http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Bash-Prog-Intro-HOWTO-3.html)

**Theory and quick reference**

There are 3 file descriptors, stdin, stdout and stderr (std=standard).

Basically you can:

redirect stdout to a file
redirect stderr to a file
redirect stdout to a stderr
redirect stderr to a stdout
redirect stderr and stdout to a file
redirect stderr and stdout to stdout
redirect stderr and stdout to stderr
1 'represents' stdout and 2 stderr.
A little note for seeing this things: with the less command you can view both stdout (which will remain on the buffer) and the stderr that will be printed on the screen, but erased as you try to 'browse' the buffer.

* stdout 2 file

This will cause the ouput of a program to be written to a file.

         ls -l > ls-l.txt
        
Here, a file called 'ls-l.txt' will be created and it will contain what you would see on the screen if you type the command 'ls -l' and execute it.

* stderr 2 file  

This will cause the stderr ouput of a program to be written to a file.

         grep da * 2> grep-errors.txt
        
Here, a file called 'grep-errors.txt' will be created and it will contain what you would see the stderr portion of the output of the 'grep da *' command.  

* stdout 2 stderr

This will cause the stderr ouput of a program to be written to the same filedescriptor than stdout.

         grep da * 1>&2 
        
Here, the stdout portion of the command is sent to stderr, you may notice that in differen ways.  

* stderr 2 stdout

This will cause the stderr ouput of a program to be written to the same filedescriptor than stdout.

         grep * 2>&1
        
Here, the stderr portion of the command is sent to stdout, if you pipe to less, you'll see that lines that normally 'dissapear' (as they are written to stderr) are being kept now (because they're on stdout).  

* stderr and stdout 2 file

This will place every output of a program to a file. This is suitable sometimes for cron entries, if you want a command to pass in absolute silence.

         rm -f $(find / -name core) &> /dev/null 
        
This (thinking on the cron entry) will delete every file called 'core' in any directory. Notice that you should be pretty sure of what a command is doing if you are going to wipe it's output.

* change permissions of files  
each digit is for: user, group and other.  

`chmod 754 myfile`: this means the user has read, write and execute permssion; member in the same group has read and execute permission but no write permission; other people in the world only has read permission.  

4 stands for "read",    
2 stands for "write",    
1 stands for "execute", and    
0 stands for "no permission."    
So 7 is the combination of permissions 4+2+1 (read, write, and execute), 5 is 4+0+1 (read, no write, and execute), and 4 is 4+0+0 (read, no write, and no execute).    

It is sometimes hard to remember. one can use the letter:The letters u, g, and o stand for "user", "group", and "other"; "r", "w", and "x" stand for "read", "write", and "execute", respectively.    

`chmod u+x myfile`    
`chmod g+r myfile`

### How to name files
It is really important to name your files correctly! see a [ppt](https://rawgit.com/Reproducible-Science-Curriculum/rr-organization1/master/organization-01-slides.html) by Jenny Bryan.

Three principles for (file) names:
* Machine readable (do not put special characters and space in the name)  
* Human readable (Easy to figure out what the heck something is, based on its name, add slug)  
* Plays well with default ordering:   

1. Put something numeric first  

2. Use the ISO 8601 standard for dates (YYYY-MM-DD) 

3. Left pad other numbers with zeros  

![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4106146/17389870/5dfc54c4-59cd-11e6-9293-a1f8789c8352.png)

**If you have to rename the files...**

* [brename](https://github.com/shenwei356/brename) A cross-platform command-line tool for safely batch renaming files/directories via regular expression (supporting Windows, Linux and OS X) from ShenWei is very useful!

**Good naming of your files can help you to extract meta data from the file name**  
* [dirdf](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/dirdf) Create tidy data frames of file metadata from directory and file names.

```r
> dir("examples/dataset_1/")
[1] "2013-06-26_BRAFWTNEG_Plasmid-Cellline-100_A01.csv"
[2] "2013-06-26_BRAFWTNEG_Plasmid-Cellline-100_A02.csv"

* **Have you ever had problem to reuse one of your own published figures due to copyright of the journal?**
Here is the [solution](https://storify.com/LorenaABarba/reactions-to-my-tip-on-how-i-use-figshare)! from @LorenaABarba

>As an early adopter of the Figshare repository, I came up with a strategy that serves both our open-science and our reproducibility goals, and also helps with this problem: for the main results in any new paper, we would share the data, plotting script and figure under a CC-BY license, by first uploading them to Figshare.
