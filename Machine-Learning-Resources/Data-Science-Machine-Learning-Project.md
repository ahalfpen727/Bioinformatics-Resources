# data-science-machine-learning-project
This is the repo for the machine learning project of the data science specification.  
The HTML version can be viewed at [Rpubs](http://rpubs.com/crazyhottommy/machine-learning)  
The model building takes long time and uses a lot of memory. I run out of time, otherwise, I should 
make the HTML version more elegant (suppress warnings, more figures etc...) and learn to use github pages.
