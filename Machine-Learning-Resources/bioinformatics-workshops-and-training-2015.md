Cold Spring Harbor has been offering advanced workshops and short
courses in the life sciences for years. Relevant workshops include the
Genome Access Course, Genetics of Complex Human Diseases, Statistical
Methods for Functional Genomics, Programming for Biology, Computational
and Comparative Genomics, and others. Unlike most of the others below,
you won't find material from past years' CSHL courses available online.

**Canadian Bioinformatics Workshops:**
[bioinformatics.ca/workshops](http://bioinformatics.ca/workshops)

Bioinformatics.ca through its Canadian Bioinformatics Workshops (CBW)
series began offering one and two week short courses in bioinformatics,
genomics and proteomics in 1999. The more recent workshops focus on
training researchers using advanced high-throughput technologies on the
latest approaches being used in computational biology to deal with the
new data. Course material from [past
workshops](http://bioinformatics.ca/workshops/2014) is freely available
online, including both audio/video lectures and slideshows. Topics
include microarray analysis, RNA-seq analysis, genome rearrangements,
copy number alteration, pathway analysis, genome visualization, gene
function prediction, functional annotation, data analysis using R,
statistics for metabolomics, and much more.

**UC Davis Bioinformatics Training Program:**
[training.bioinformatics.ucdavis.edu](http://training.bioinformatics.ucdavis.edu/)

The UC Davis Bioinformatics Training program offers several intensive
[short bootcamp
workshops](http://training.bioinformatics.ucdavis.edu/bootcamps/ "Boot Camps | UC Davis Bioinformatics Training Program")
on RNA-seq, data analysis and visualization, and cloud computing with a
focus on Amazon's computing resources. They also offer a week-long
[Bioinformatics Short
Course](http://training.bioinformatics.ucdavis.edu/courses/ "Courses | UC Davis Bioinformatics Training Program"),
covering in-depth the practical theory and application of cutting-edge
next-generation sequencing techniques. Every course's documentation is
[freely available
online](http://training.bioinformatics.ucdavis.edu/documentation/ "Documentation | UC Davis Bioinformatics Training Program"),
even if you didn't take the course.

**MSU NGS Summer Course:**
<http://bioinformatics.msu.edu/ngs-summer-course-2014>

This intensive two week summer course will introduce attendees with a
strong biology background to the practice of analyzing short-read
sequencing data from Illumina and other next-gen platforms. The first
week will introduce students to computational thinking and large-scale
data analysis on UNIX platforms. The second week will focus on mapping,
assembly, and analysis of short-read data for resequencing, ChIP-seq,
and RNAseq. [Materials from previous courses are freely available
online](http://ged.msu.edu/angus/tutorials-2013/) under a CC-by-SA

**MBL Molecular Evolution Workshop:**
[hermes.mbl.edu/education/...](http://hermes.mbl.edu/education/courses/special_topics/mole.html)

One of the longest-running courses listed here (est. 1988), the Workshop
on Molecular Evolution at Woods Hole presents a series of lectures,
discussions, and bioinformatic exercises that span contemporary topics
in molecular evolution. The course addresses phylogenetic analysis,
population genetics, database and sequence matching, molecular evolution
and development, and comparative genomics, [using software
packages](https://molevol.mbl.edu/wiki/index.php/Software) including
AWTY, BEAST, BEST, Clustal W/X, FASTA, FigTree, GARLI, MIGRATE, LAMARC,
MAFFT, MP-EST, MrBayes, PAML, PAUP\*, PHYLIP, STEM, STEM-hy, and
SeaView. Some of the course materials can be found by digging around the
[course wiki](https://molevol.mbl.edu/wiki/index.php/Main_Page).

**UW Summer Institute in Statistical Genetics:**
[sisg.biostat.washington.edu](http://sisg.biostat.washington.edu)

consists of a series of two-and-a-half day modules over a 3-week period
designed to introduce geneticists to modern methods of statistical
analysis and to introduce statisticians to the statistical challenges
posed by modern genetic data. Prerequisites are minimal, and the modular
nature of the Institute enables participants to design a program best
suited to their backgrounds and interests. Most participants take two or
three modules. See the
[schedule](http://www.biostat.washington.edu/suminst/sisg/schedule) and
the [list of SISG
modules](http://www.biostat.washington.edu/suminst/sisg/modules) for

[http://www.youtube.com/...](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iffR3fWv4xw&list=PLOU2XLYxmsIK9qQfztXeybpHvru-TrqAP)

Google Developers recognized that most developers learn R in bits and
pieces, which can leave significant knowledge gaps. To help fill these
gaps, they created a series of [introductory R programming
videos](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iffR3fWv4xw&list=PLOU2XLYxmsIK9qQfztXeybpHvru-TrqAP "R 1.1 - Initial Setup and Navigation - YouTube").
These videos provide a solid foundation for programming tools, data
manipulation, and functions in the R language and software. The series
of short videos is organized into four subsections: intro to R, loading
data and more data formats, data processing and writing functions. Start
watching the [YouTube playlist
here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iffR3fWv4xw&list=PLOU2XLYxmsIK9qQfztXeybpHvru-TrqAP "R 1.1 - Initial Setup and Navigation - YouTube").

Course material includes slideshow presentations and exercises (in the
practicals directory), which give code examples from everything from
quality control, assembly, and assembly evaluation.
